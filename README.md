## Purpose
This project is quite small, just as the basic play ground to store some parts of codes interested me and how I did some minor modifications to make them available.

## Technology
Pure PHP with some JS. The basic skeletion shoule be sketch bootstrap, and the other major parts would be High Chart, D3 and Three JS.
